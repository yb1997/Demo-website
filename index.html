            Makkan peda is made using khoya (milk solids), maida (all purpose flour) as main ingredients, stuffed with dry fruits and nuts.
            It is very famous in Arcot. So it has also the name Arcot makkan peda. When I was thinking of Diwali, I thought I should try Makkan
            peda by stuffing nuts in Gulab jamun mix. Then when I saw few videos in youtube, I got really tempted to try from scratch. When I
            googled, I got the recipe from Hindu, but the measurements were really confusing. It was given in weight and too much quantity too.
            So I sat and converted everything to cup measurements for easier understanding and reduced the quantity too. I was so scared until I
            fried the pedas in oil as everything was rounded up and approximate measures. But…. It – was – perfect!
